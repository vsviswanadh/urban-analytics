Dashboard Project: Urban Analytics Insights
Overview
This repository contains a collection of interactive dashboards analyzing key urban metrics across various cities and states. The dashboards provide visualizations for air quality (AQI and PM2.5), population demographics (median age, literacy rates, male/female population), transportation (public buses, electric vehicles, metro networks, daily passengers), and crime rates (total crimes, murder, assault, theft, cybercrime). These tools are designed to support data-driven decision-making and will serve as a foundation for future projects.

Dashboards Included
Air Quality Dashboard
Displays average AQI (102), PM2.5 (148), and other pollutants (CO, NO2, O3, PM10, SO2) by city.
Includes scatter plots and bar charts for comparative analysis.
Population Demographics Dashboard
Highlights average median age (30.59), male population (5.39M), female population (5.08M), and literacy rates by city.
Features pie charts and bar graphs for population distribution.
Transportation Dashboard
Shows sum of public buses (581K), electric vehicles (47M), registered vehicles (893M), and average daily passengers (798.86K).
Includes metro network length by city and yearly trends (2019-2024).
Crime Rate Dashboard
Presents total crimes (5M), murder (77K), crimes against women (895K), assault (1M), theft (2M), and cybercrime (575K).
Offers yearly crime trends and city-wise crime distribution.
Purpose
These dashboards were created to provide a comprehensive view of urban data, enabling insights into environmental health, demographic trends, transportation infrastructure, and public safety. They will be leveraged for upcoming projects to drive innovative solutions and impactful outcomes.

Acknowledgments
A special thanks to those who encouraged me to undertake this exciting challengeâ€”your support has been invaluable in bringing this project to life.

Usage
The dashboards are available as static images in this repository.
For interactive versions or further customization, please contact the author.
Data is based on aggregated statistics as of June 26, 2025.
Future Work
Enhance dashboards with real-time data integration.
Add predictive analytics for air quality and crime trends.
Expand coverage to additional cities and metrics.
